# Phrase-Hunters (Unit 3) Techdegree Project

Createa word guessing game: "Phrase Hunter." You'll use Python and OOP(Object-Oriented Programming) approaches to select a phrase at random, hidden from the player. A player tries to guess the phrase by inputting individual characters. A player tries to guess the phrase by inputting individual characters. Can they guess the phrase before they run out of attempts?


**Rules of the Game**

* This game will be entirely console/terminal based

* The player's goal is to guess all the letters in a hidden, random phrase. At the beginning of the game, the player only sees the number of letters abd words in the phrase, represented by an underscore character _ as a placeholder on the screen for a given letter for that phrase.

* The player inputs a guess for a letter in the phrase.

* Once a correct letter is guessed, a player cannot guess that letter again.

* If the guessed letter is in the phrase at lease once, the phrase will replace all positions showing the underscore _ with appropriate letter. All occurences of that letter are made visible (so if there are 3 A's, all of the A's in the phrase appear at once.)

* If the selected letter is not in the phrase, the player loses a "life" (the player only has a limited number of "lives").

* The player keeps choosing letter until they reveal all the letters in the phrase, or until they make five incorrect guesses.
